# 1. Automation/AI Technologies' Impact on Human-Technology Interaction


## Three Examples of How Automation/AI Technologies Changed How Humans Interact With a Specific Technology

| Student Id | Example | 
| :-: | :- |
| 25040030 | AI-made entratainment content |
| 25040024 | Writing tools |
| 25040032 | Music production |

#### AI-made entretainment content
Over time, social media shifted to shorter form content, like Vine, Tiktok, Youtube shorts and etc., designed to grab attention quickly. To maximize views and profit, creators turned to using AI-generated narration of shocking stories/content, often over fast-paced visuals like parkour videos.

#### Writing tools
How the new AI-powered text processors have changed the writing process forever, making the new purpose of this technology not only creating and editing files, but generating the content of the files themselves.

#### Music production
As has already happened with singers, nowadays, you don't need to know about music to be able to compose/produce a song. First, choose the genre, then the artist whose voice you like the most and then a topic. Finally, let AI create a hit for you.

## Text processor


### Introduction

Humans have looked for the best way to preserve their knowledge, and as a result of this, we developed written languages. Ergo, civilizations made writing tools to make this process more efficient.

We all write in our daily lives, so its evolution is directly connected to everyone.


### Selected Example: handwriting


#### User needs, wants, and requirements

Created to preserve precise information instead of relying on word of mouth or on drawings.

Requires a codification process of languages, in order to develop a standard. Also, some writing aids, such as paper, leather, stone, ink, graphite...


#### Solution Description

The biggest drawback is the socioeconomic segregation, with those who are literate versus illiterate.

Handwriting facilitated learning and research, contributing to future technologies development.

### Selected Example: type writer


#### User needs, wants, and requirements

The typewriter solved the readability problem that handwriting has. Furthermore, the writing speed increased.

It was developed thanks to the invention of the printing press and motivated by the economical growth.

In addition, efficiency increased because of the QWERTY layout.

#### Solution Description

The main drawbacks were portability and the difficulty of correcting the typing errors.


### Selected Example: plain text processor


#### User needs, wants, and requirements

.txt files are an easier way to interchange information, as the physical space they need is smaller.

This application enabled the user to easily modify the content of the file, adding, deleting, or pasting as much as they wanted.


#### Solution Description

The invention of personal computers enabled the creation of many desktop applications.

Unfortunately, the access to this technology was restricted by its price.

### Selected Example: text editor


#### User needs, wants, and requirements

The text editors improved the plain text processors by:

- Formatting the text (size, font, color, position, impages...)
- Autocorrecting spelling mistakes
- Implementing cloud storage and multiplatform

#### Solution Description

Due to autocorrect, people stopped knowing how to properly spell some words.

### Selected Example: AI-powered text editor


#### User needs, wants, and requirements
Thanks to the implementation of AI, people were empowered to:

- Save time by minimizing information research
- Writing some ideas that wouldn't come to your mind
- Writing in a specific way you wouldn't normally apply to your compositions
- Translate texts inmediately
- Summarizing texts
- Converting text into voice and vice versa
- Having convenient integrations

#### Solution Description

Different users have an special interest in specific benefits that require different AI features.

For instance, it makes using technology to write more accessible to older people. When they have difficulties typing, text prediction does the job for them.

Another example could be assisting nonfluent speakers when writing. Text paraphrasers adjust the style of the composition, modifying the structure of sentences and the vocabulary. 

Although text prediction has been here for a while, the development of AI has changed the way the model works. Formerly, the models suggested correct words (words that could fit by the language rules). Now, it focuses more on the semantics and the context. This was possible thanks to the invention of transformer models. They incorporate a new technology named attention mechanisms, which solves the loss of context compared to the previous technology.  

### Selected Example: Current challenges in the context of Automation/AI

A challenge that has presented itself is the user experience differing between devices, where the fluidity of accepting the predictions is uncomfortable on the mobile version. Thus, presenting a new pathway to innovate and to make it more seamless for the user.

Furthermore, general users are not well-informed about the privacy policies. In the case of chat-based AI solutions, it is easier to control what you share because you decide the prompts you send. Whereas in the editor, the file you are writing could unavoidably contain lots of private data. For example, CV, contracts, proprietary, deeds... 

#### Stakeholder Analysis

- Users
    - The user doesn't learn the skill to compose quality texts themself
    - The user doesn't think of ideas by oneself
    - The user doesn't learn/practice the right structure for each type of text
    - The user doesn't retain that much grammar

- Stakeholders
    - Developers and researchers
        - Implementing an intuitive way of interacting with the AI
        - Fitting the right AI model
    - Business leaders
        - Differentiation from competitors
        - Price increase
        - Complicated budget
    - Politicians
        - Copyright 
        - Data privacy
        - Better understanding of AI

- Society
    - Society doubts their own literacy and self-expression; ergo, they question their intelligence, creativeity, and etc. Thus, it makes them feel that they have to use AI more to mitigate this pitfall, and AI becomes more normalized in daily life.

A human-centered future development idea is combining text recognition with AI. Sometimes, when dictating, we make pauses or say interjections that don't need to be reflected in the text. AI would recognise them and also identify punctuation marks (period, period new paragraph, comma, question and exclamation marks...)
by the tone you use while speaking.

# 2. AI vs. Human-Centered AI

The difference between the development paradigms of AI is that the traditional one works in the background of its applications, not interacting directly with a final user. While the human-centered AI is communicating with the final user.

The development paradigm of AI is designed to optimize, automatize, etc., while the second one is meant to collaborate and interact with the human user.

The human-AI-centered models, as they try to mimic humans, are provided with artificial moral values and emotions. These are controlled by the developers, still, the AI doesn't have the capacity to reason about ethics (yet?).

The most recent AI products, like ChatGPT, have been a recurrent topic in the media, making AI a public concern. Now companies have to take into account society's opinion when choosing a development direction.

Regarding long-term sustainability, we need to consider that humans keep evolving and changing their way of thinking. In order to keep up with it, AI has to be in constant training and has to take into account the data's age (old data **may** be less relevant). 

In the matter of the environment, we should try to find more eco-friendly solutions that require less computer power. For example, for about 50 prompts, ChatGPT will use about 30 liters of water.
